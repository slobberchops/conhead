Conhead
=======

Consistent header management.

CLI tool for applying and maintaining consistent headers across source
files.

-   Add headers to files that don't have them.
-   Update fields in files that already have them.
-   Maintain different header configurations for different file
    types

Installation
------------

Conhead is available as the Python ``conhead`` package.

For example, to install using `pipx`_:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pipx install conhead
    $ conhead --help
    Usage: conhead [OPTIONS] SRC

.. _pipx: https://github.com/pypa/pipx

Configuration
-------------

Configure ``conhead`` via ``pyproject.toml``. Each header template
is configured via a separate ``[tools.conhead.header.<name>]``
section. Each section is a header definition and can be applied
to one or more file extensions.


Example:

.. code-block:: toml

    [tools.conhead.header.hashhead]
    extensions = ['py', 'toml', 'yaml']
    template = """
        # Copyright {{YEARS}} Organized Organization
        # SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

    """

    [tools.conhead.header.slashhead]
    extensions = ['c', 'cpp', 'java']
    template = """
        // Copyright {{YEARS}} Organized Organization
        // SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

    """

Template Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A few things to note about the template definition.

Each TOML ``tools.conhead.header`` section has a few options:

-   **extensions:** A list of extensions that the header definition
    applies to.
-   **template:** The header template for this header definition.
    This is the text that is applied to files that have the
    indicated extensions.

Header Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notice a few things about the header template.

-   The text of the template is indented for better readability
    withing the ``pyproject.toml`` configuration file, however
    ``conhead`` de-indents this text for you.
-   The template contains a field that is kept up to date in
    the target source file. In this case the ``{{YEARS}}`` field
    writes the current year into every new template. If a file
    already contains a header with the year in it, and the year
    is different from the current year, it is updated to show
    a range of years. For example, a new template would have
    the ``{{YEARS}}`` field replaced with ``2020`` if it was
    first written in ``2020``. When the header is then updated
    in ``2022``, this field is rewritten as ``2020-2022``.
-   If you need to write some text that contains certain
    characters used to describe fields, you must escape them.
    Examples are ``\{``, ``\}`` and `\\`. These characters will
    appear in the rendered header without the preceding slash.

Usage
-----

Let's say there is a python file without a header at ``hello.py``:

.. code-block:: python


    def hello():
        print("Greetings!")

You can apply the ``hashhead`` header template defined in
``pyproject.toml`` and view the results by:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ conhead hello.py
    WARNING: missing header: hello.py

    $ cat hello.py
    # Copyright 2022 Organized Organization
    # SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0


    def hello():
        print("Greetings!")

``conhead`` will recognize the header if you apply it to ``hello.py``
again and will not write a second header.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ conhead hello.py

    $ cat hello.py
    # Copyright 2022 Organized Organization
    # SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0


    def hello():
        print("Greetings!")

Pre-commit
----------

``conhead`` is `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`_ ready. To use
with pre-commit, add the repo to your ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``.

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - repo: https://github.com/slobberchops/conhead
      rev: v0.4.0
      hooks:

        - id: conhead
